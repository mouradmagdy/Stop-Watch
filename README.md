# Stopwatch 
## Introduction
This project presents a stopwatch implemented on an AVR microcontroller using a 7-segment display. The stopwatch accurately measures time in hours, minutes, and seconds, providing functionality to stop, resume, and reset.

Features
* Stop/Resume: The stopwatch can be stopped, and resumed  with the press of dedicated buttons.
* Reset: The stopwatch can be reset to zero at any time with a separate button.
* Time Measurement: Accurate measurement of elapsed time in hours, minutes, and seconds.
* 7-Segment Display: Utilizes a 7-segment display to represent the elapsed time for easy reading.

### Hardware Requirements
* AVR Microcontroller (e.g., ATmega32)
* Push Buttons ( Stop, Resume, and Reset functionality)
* 7-Segment Display
